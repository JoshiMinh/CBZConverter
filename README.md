# CBZ Converter

## Overview
The CBZ Converter app was created to fill in the gap of converting `.CBZ` files into `.PDF` files, directly on your Android Phone.

## Capabilities
- Single CBZ to PDF Conversion: Convert a single `.CBZ` file into a `.PDF` file.
- Batch Conversion: Convert multiple `.CBZ` files into separate `.PDF` files (Multi-Select CBZ Files).
- Sorting Options: Sort files based on their offset within the `.CBZ` file or by file name (Default is by file name in Ascending order).
- Page Limits: Set a maximum number of pages for the PDF and automatically split the PDF into multiple parts if necessary.
- File Name Override: Override the default name of the exported PDF (Default is the file name of the `.CBZ` file).
- Output Directory Override: Specify an output directory for the exported PDF (Default is the `Download` directory).
- Merging CBZ Files: Merge all selected CBZ files into a single PDF while preserving the flexibility of all previously mentioned options. 
  - Can still apply additional configuration such as: sorting, page limits, name overrides, and directory selection to the merged PDF.
